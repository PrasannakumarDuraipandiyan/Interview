Here’s a list of commonly asked Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) interview questions tailored for an experienced .NET developer or technical lead. Answers are also provided to help you prepare effectively.

### **General OOP Concepts**
#### Q1: What are the four main principles of OOP?
**Answer:**
1. **Encapsulation**: Wrapping data and methods in a single unit (class) to restrict access.
2. **Inheritance**: Deriving new classes from existing ones to promote code reuse.
3. **Polymorphism**: Ability to redefine methods in derived classes (overriding) or perform actions differently based on input types (overloading).
4. **Abstraction**: Hiding implementation details and exposing only essential features through interfaces or abstract classes.

#### Q2: What is the difference between an abstract class and an interface in .NET?
**Answer:**
- **Abstract Class**:
  - Can have both abstract and concrete methods.
  - Supports constructors.
  - Can include fields.
  - Can implement methods.
- **Interface**:
  - Cannot have implementation (up to .NET Framework; default implementations allowed in .NET Core 3.0+).
  - Cannot include fields or constructors.
  - Used to define contracts that classes must implement.

#### Q3: How does method overloading differ from method overriding?
**Answer:**
- **Method Overloading**:
  - Happens within the same class.
  - Involves methods with the same name but different parameter lists.
  - Compile-time polymorphism.
- **Method Overriding**:
  - Requires inheritance.
  - Involves methods with the same name and signature in the base and derived classes.
  - Runtime polymorphism (requires `virtual`, `override`, or `abstract` keywords in .NET).

#### Q4: Can you explain the difference between `IS-A` and `HAS-A` relationships?
**Answer:**
- **IS-A**: Represents inheritance; a subclass is a type of its parent class (e.g., Dog IS-A Animal).
- **HAS-A**: Represents composition; a class contains another class as a member (e.g., Car HAS-A Engine).

### **.NET-Specific OOP Questions**
#### Q5: What is the difference between a class and a struct in .NET?
**Answer:**
- **Class**:
  - Reference type.
  - Stored in heap memory.
  - Supports inheritance.
- **Struct**:
  - Value type.
  - Stored in stack memory.
  - Cannot inherit other classes (but can implement interfaces).

---

#### Q6: How does garbage collection affect objects in .NET?
**Answer:**
- Garbage collection automatically manages memory by reclaiming objects no longer in use.
- Objects in the heap are tracked by generations (0, 1, 2). The garbage collector optimizes cleanup based on these generations.
- Finalizers (`~ClassName`) can be overridden for cleanup, but they introduce overhead.

---

#### Q7: How is polymorphism implemented in C#?
**Answer:**
Polymorphism can be implemented using:
1. **Method Overloading** (Compile-time): Multiple methods with the same name but different parameter types.
2. **Method Overriding** (Runtime): Using `virtual` in the base class and `override` in the derived class.
3. **Interfaces and Abstract Classes**: Allow substituting derived types at runtime.

### **Advanced Concepts**
#### Q8: What is dependency injection, and how does it relate to OOP?
**Answer:**
- Dependency Injection (DI) is a design pattern to achieve Inversion of Control (IoC).
- Instead of creating dependencies directly, they are provided to the class externally (e.g., through constructors or properties).
- Promotes abstraction, reduces coupling, and simplifies testing.

#### Q9: Can you explain SOLID principles in the context of .NET development?
**Answer:**
1. **S**ingle Responsibility Principle: A class should have one and only one reason to change.
2. **O**pen/Closed Principle: Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification.
3. **L**iskov Substitution Principle: Subtypes should be substitutable for their base types without altering functionality.
4. **I**nterface Segregation Principle: No client should be forced to depend on methods it does not use.
5. **D**ependency Inversion Principle: Depend on abstractions, not on concrete implementations.

---

#### Q10: How is `sealed` used in .NET, and what are its implications?
**Answer:**
- The `sealed` keyword prevents a class from being inherited.
- Often used to restrict further modification or when a class is designed for specific use cases.
- Example:
  ```csharp
  public sealed class FinalClass {
      // Code
  }
  ```

---

#### Q11: What is the difference between shallow copy and deep copy?
**Answer:**
- **Shallow Copy**: Copies the object’s references, not the actual objects they refer to.
- **Deep Copy**: Creates an entirely new copy of the object and all objects it references.

---

#### Q12: What are extension methods in C#? How are they related to OOP?
**Answer:**
- Extension methods allow adding new methods to existing types without modifying their source code.
- They support the principle of **open/closed** by extending functionality without altering the original implementation.
- Example:
  ```csharp
  public static class StringExtensions {
      public static bool IsEmpty(this string str) {
          return string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(str);
      }
  }
  ```
